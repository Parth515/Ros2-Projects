ROS 2 Navigation Stack (also known as Nav2). 
The ROS 2 Navigation Stack is a collection of software packages that help mobile robot move from a starting location to a goal location safely. 


Real-World Applications
The ROS 2 Navigation Stack can be used in a number of real-world robotic applications: 

Ground Delivery
Hospitals and Medical Centers
Hotels (Room Service)
Offices
Restaurants
Warehouses
And moreâ€¦


In this project, I work with a simulated robot in a simulated world. 
Simulate robots before building them in order to test out different algorithms.
